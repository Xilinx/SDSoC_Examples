SDSoC (C/C++) Example Repository
===============================

Welcome to the SDSoC (C/C++) example repository. This repository contains the
latest examples to get you started with application optimization targeting
Xilinx Embedded FPGA acceleration boards. All examples are ready to be compiled
and executed on boards. The "getting_started" directory contains latest SDSoC
examples which are intended to help in quick learning of various SDSoC key
concepts. It also provides insights into new features and optimization tricks
which are quite handy in identical scenarios.
